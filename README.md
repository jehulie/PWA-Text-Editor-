## Description

This is a simple text editor that runs in the browser. The application meets PWA criteria and uses idb to store data in an IndexedDB database on the client side. Other featues include:

* Data persistence: when the user reloads the page, the text typed and saved on the interface persists.

* The application can be downloaded via the Install button or the icon for downloading on the browser - thereby ensuring seamless user experience between online and offline funcitonality.
